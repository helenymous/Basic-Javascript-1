Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1]; // secondLetterOfFirstName is "d"

Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation:

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2]; // Change this line
